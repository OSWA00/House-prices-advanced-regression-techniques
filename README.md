# House prices - advanced regression techniques
## Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boost

This is my second project out of ten, on my path to learn, understand and apply machine learning. The objectives of this project are:

- Predicting the price of a house given its characteristics.

- "Hello World!" of regression problems.
